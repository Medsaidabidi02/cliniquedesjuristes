## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Rate Limiting âœ…

**Login Endpoint:**
- **Limit:** 5 attempts per 15 minutes
- **Scope:** Per IP address
- **Action:** Block with clear message after limit exceeded
- **Skip:** Successful logins (allows retry after success)

**Session Ping Endpoint:**
- **Limit:** 1 request per 4 minutes
- **Purpose:** Prevents ping abuse
- **Aligns with:** 5-minute ping interval

**Admin Endpoints:**
- **Limit:** 30 requests per minute
- **Scope:** All admin routes
- **Applied at:** Router level (middleware)

**General API:**
- **Fallback:** 60 requests per minute for any endpoint
- **Provides:** Baseline protection

### 2. Authentication & Authorization âœ…

**JWT Token Security:**
- Includes session ID for immediate invalidation
- Configurable expiration (1h production, 7d dev)
- Signed with secret key
- Verified on every request

**Session Validation:**
- Database-backed session checking
- Valid flag checked on every request
- is_active flag for single-session enforcement
- last_activity tracking for staleness detection

**Admin Protection:**
- Requires authentication
- Requires admin flag in user record
- Rate limited separately
- All operations logged

### 3. Data Protection âœ…

**Device Fingerprints:**
- Hashed using SHA-256
- Not reversible to original data
- Used only for same-device detection
- Not personally identifiable

**Password Handling:**
- Bcrypt hashing (10 rounds)
- Never logged or exposed in responses
- Compared securely with timing-safe comparison

**Sensitive Data:**
- No passwords in logs
- No tokens in logs
- IP addresses logged (required for security)
- User agents logged (required for security)

### 4. Input Validation âœ…

**Email:**
- Normalized (trimmed, lowercased)
- Validated format
- SQL injection protected (parameterized queries)

**Password:**
- Required for all auth operations
- No length validation on input (checked after hash)
- Protected from timing attacks

**User IDs:**
- Validated as integers
- Bounds checking
- Foreign key constraints in database

### 5. Session Security âœ…

**Immediate Invalidation:**
- No caching of session state
- Database checked on every request
- Cross-device invalidation instant

**Session Hijacking Protection:**
- Session ID is UUID (unpredictable)
- Device fingerprint tied to session
- IP address changes monitored
- User agent changes monitored

**Stale Session Detection:**
- Automatic expiry after inactivity
- Cleanup task removes old sessions
- Grace period configurable

### 6. Denial of Service Protection âœ…

**Rate Limiting:**
- Applied to all sensitive endpoints
- Per-IP tracking
- Configurable limits
- Standard headers included

**Resource Limits:**
- Database connection pooling
- Query timeouts
- JSON payload size limits
- Request timeout configured

### 7. CORS Configuration âœ…

**Origins:**
- Whitelist-based (production)
- Configurable per environment
- Credentials supported
- Preflight handled

**Methods:**
- Only required methods allowed
- OPTIONS handled correctly
- Custom headers documented

### 8. Database Security âœ…

**SQL Injection:**
- All queries parameterized
- No string concatenation
- ORM-style query builder used

**Access Control:**
- Foreign key constraints
- Cascade deletes configured
- Indexes for performance
- Unique constraints enforced

---

## Known Limitations (Acceptable)

### 1. Device Fingerprinting
**Limitation:** Can be spoofed by sophisticated attackers  
**Mitigation:** Used as convenience, not primary security  
**Impact:** Low - progressive cooldown still applies  
**Future:** Can enhance with more advanced fingerprinting

### 2. IP-Based Detection
**Limitation:** VPNs and proxies can mask true location  
**Mitigation:** Device fingerprint provides additional signal  
**Impact:** Low - affects same-device detection only  
**Future:** Can integrate IP geolocation service

### 3. Client-Side Fingerprinting
**Limitation:** Requires JavaScript enabled  
**Mitigation:** Fallback fingerprint generation  
**Impact:** Minimal - most users have JS enabled  
**Future:** Server-side fallback already implemented
